# syn
For libraries, added
#include <string.h> - for strcmp  
#include <sys/types.h> - for fork()
#include <unistd.h> - for execvp()
##include <sys/wait.h> - for waitpid()

 void generate_wallets(struct wallets* wallet) -> void generate_wallets(struct wallets* wallet,int num_wallets)
- To fix Segmentation default, pass the number of wallet as parameter

wallet_stat.c
fscanf("%s", filename); -> scanf("%s", filename);
fscanf("%s", command); -> scanf("%s", command); 
- the app should scan the user input and not file

waitpid added
- to prevent any zoombie from fork()

Added char *argv1[]={"./print_help", NULL}; to use as argument fr execvp();

Added fclose(fp)
- file was oepn and not closed

print_help.o
- At address 0x22, b8 -> bf to change instruction from eax -> edi.
