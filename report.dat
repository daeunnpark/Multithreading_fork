# wallet_stat.c 
# typography error 
inlcude <time.h> -> include <time.h>


# syn
For libraries, added
#include <string.h> - for strcmp  
#include <sys/types.h> - for fork()
#include <unistd.h> - for execvp()
#include <sys/wait.h> - for waitpid()
#include <inttypes.h> - to print uint32_t into files

 void generate_wallets(struct wallets* wallet) -> void generate_wallets(struct wallets* wallet,int num_wallets)
- To fix Segmentation default, pass the number of wallet as parameter

wallet_stat.c
fscanf("%s", filename); -> scanf("%s", filename);
fscanf("%s", command); -> scanf("%s", command); 
- the app should scan the user input and not file

waitpid added
- to prevent any zoombie from fork()

Added char *argv1[]={"./print_help", NULL}; to use as argument fr execvp();

Added fclose(fp)
- file was oepn and not closed

While loop added
- while(1) to make user to enter an existing filename, and when the file with user entered filename doesn't exist, print "FILE DOES NOT EXIST"

print_wallets()
- to print uint_32_t into files, added fprintf(fp, "%" PRIu32 "; money: ",wallet[i].key); 

main()
- printf("There is no wallet generated); added when user wants to print before generating wallet  

print_help.o
- At address 0x22, b8 -> bf to change instruction from eax -> edi.
