#ERROR REPORT


For libraries, added
#include <string.h> - for strcmp  
#include <sys/types.h> - for fork()
#include <unistd.h> - for execvp()
#include <sys/wait.h> - for waitpid()
#include <inttypes.h> - to print uint32_t into files
#inlcude <time.h> -> include <time.h> - correct typo   

#wallet_stat.c
void generate_wallets(struct wallets* wallet) -> void generate_wallets(struct wallets* wallet,int num_wallets)
- To fix Segmentation default, pass the number of wallet as parameter

print_wallets()
- to print uint_32_t into files, added fprintf(fp, "%" PRIu32 "; money: ",wallet[i].key); 

main()   
While loop added
- while(1) to make user to enter an existing filename, and when the file with user entered filename doesn't exist, print "FILE DOES NOT EXIST"

fscanf("%s", filename); -> scanf("%s", filename);
fscanf("%s", command); -> scanf("%s", command); 
- the app should scan the user input and not file

Added char *argv1[]={"./print_help", NULL}; to use as argument for execvp();

Added fclose(fp)
- file was oepn and not closed

waitpid function added
- to prevent any zoombie from fork()

File pointer fp2 added
- to fix memory leak from using one pointer for input filename and output filename 

printf("There is no wallet generated); added 
- when user wants to print before generating wallet, let user know that there is nothing to print

free(filename),free(command), free(wallet) added
- to fix memory leak after allocating memory
- wallet pointer is only freed right before user choose to quit the application, whose wallet is already generated

#print_help.o
At address 0x22, b8 -> bf to change instruction from eax -> edi.
- to call print() correctly
